            <h3><a href="#">About GST</a></h3>
            <p>GST is one indirect tax for the whole nation, which will make India one unified common market. GST is a single tax on the supply of goods and services, right from the manufacturer to the consumer. Credits of input taxes paid at each stage
              will be available in the subsequent stage of value addition, which makes GST essentially a tax only on value addition at each stage. The final consumer will thus bear only the GST charged by the last dealer in the supply chain, with set-off
              benefits at all the previous stages.</p>

            <h3><a href="#">GST implementation</a></h3>
            <p>The implementation of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) in India was not an overnight thought. The introduction of the tax reform has demanded both time and patience and is expected to significantly affect the Indian economy. <br> We, at

              inter-alia, GST migration, consulting in GST compliance management, and assessing the impact of GST on businesses on account of the differences in the modus operandi of the current scheme of indirect taxation (Excise duty/Service tax/VAT)
              vis-à-vis the proposed GST regime.</p><a href="#" class="read-more">Read More</a>
